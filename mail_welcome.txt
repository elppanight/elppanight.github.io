Our service is currently built upon GNU Mailman3, deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Please note that:
1. GNU Mailman 3 was rewritten with Python. While using Django as the standard web framework, the project also includes Posterious and Hyperkitty, both rewritten specifically for Mailman3. However, the source code is still under constant development, and configuration / APIs are chaging every version. Thus it is totally possible that you will run into multiple bugs while using our services. Future upgrades might also cause our services to go offline for a short time period.

2. Our server is presently deployed on GCP. Due to the pricing of GCP, a downgrade of computation resource or migration to other platforms is planned. The stability and responsiveness might be affected thereafter.
